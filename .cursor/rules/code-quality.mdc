## Rules

### Critical Rules - Strict Enforcement Required

1. **No Code Duplication**: Before writing logic, verify it doesn't already exist elsewhere. If similar functionality exists, refactor to reuse that code even if it requires modification.

2. **150-Line Limit**: Files CANNOT exceed 150 lines of code under ANY circumstances. Longer files indicate a violation of single responsibility and must be split into multiple files with focused responsibilities.

3. **Comprehensive Testing**: All code must have associated specs to ensure it's fully tested.

4. **No Extraneous Code**: Do not add ANY code that isn't directly related to requirements without explicit permission. This includes logs, comments, or even single words.

5. **Documentation Requirements**: Document all new files with a summary of their purpose. Update documentation when making meaningful changes to existing files.

6. **Code Cleanup**: After implementation, review the entire codebase and remove anything not necessary for the feature to run.

### Best Practices

- Prefer simple, readable solutions over complex ones
- Keep methods short and focused on a single task (max 10 lines)
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Follow Rails naming conventions
- Add appropriate error handling for all operations
- Comment complex logic but keep comments minimal and meaningful
- Make surgical changes rather than wholesale rewrites
