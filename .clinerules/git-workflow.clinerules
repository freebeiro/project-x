## Rules

### Branch Strategy

- Use feature branches for new features (format: `feature/feature-name`)
- Use bugfix branches for bug fixes (format: `bugfix/issue-description`)
- No direct commits to the main branch
- Rebase feature branches on main before submitting pull requests

### Commit Standards

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages in imperative mood
- Keep commits focused on single logical changes
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages when applicable
- Example format: `Fix: JWT token validation for expired tokens (#123)`

### Pull Request Process

- Create descriptive PRs with clear titles and descriptions
- Include what changes were made and why
- Link related issues
- Ensure all tests pass before requesting review
- Pull requests should be reviewed by at least one other developer
- Address all review comments before merging

### Code Review Criteria

- Code meets all requirements specified in the issue/task
- Code follows SOLID principles and project standards
- All tests pass
- Code passes linting with no warnings
- Documentation is updated where necessary
- Security implications have been considered
- Performance implications have been considered
